     <p>Open distance learning (ODL) is the combination of two concepts: strong open learning and distance education. This way of learning is called continuing education, learning-centered education, distance education, distance learning, flexible learning, or distributed learning.</p>

       <h2 class="panel-title">Defining Open-Distance Learning (ODL)</h2>
       <p class="author">Article by Bea Phoemela M. Recto</p>
       <p>Students study independently, guided by the teacher, using specially designed learning materials and multimedia, and there is two-way communication between the teacher and the student.</p>
       <p>Open learning is a vision of an educational system in which education is available to all people with few restrictions. It emphasizes the system's flexibility in overcoming problems caused by barriers such as age, geographical location, time constraints, and economic situation. The idea of ODL is similar to the idea of open learning (OL), which is a way of learning based on access and flexibility to make education fair for everyone. It is a learning-centered approach in which learners decide what, how, when, and where they want to learn. As they learn, they self-evaluate and choose their career path. So, ODL is a system that brings together the ideas of distance education, open learning, and flexible learning.</p>
       <p>And now we live in a world that is dominated by technology. Open and Distance E-Learning, abbreviated as ODeL (with a lowercase e), is now the official name for ODL. ODeL is also known as distance education, e-learning, flexible learning, online learning, and blended learning. These are all terms that are used interchangeably.</p>

    <div class="container grid grid-container-2">
     <div>
      <p>Open learning, distance education, and e-learning are the three components that are recognized as constituting ODeL's three-pronged approach. These terms referred to any and all types of educational provisions that make use of modern technologies to enact valid combinations of synchronous and asynchronous communication between the learner and the educator, who may be physically separated from one another for all or part of the duration of the learning experience.</p>

      <h3 class="panel-subtitle">Synchronous</h3>
      <p>Synchronous means “at the same time.” Online, live, and interactive learning environments are what this term describes. Real-time interaction via the internet is required. This is accomplished via technological means like teleconferencing.</p>

     <div id="async">
      <img class="display-img" src="images/Asynchronous.png" alt="Asynchronous Illustration">
      <h3 class="panel-subtitle">Asynchronous</h3>
      <p>Weekly deadline groups are given to students. They can go at their own pace if they want to. Increased chances for student participation are an added benefit of asynchronous distance learning. Asynchronous learning provides instructors and students with the freedom to work on assignments and access course materials at their own pace.

      <p class="author">Article by Christian James Reyes</p>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>The National Extension Institute, which was founded in the UK in 1963 and subsequently provided a model for the development of the UP Open University in the 1990s, is where the idea for ODL first emerged.</li>
        <li>E-learning had not yet been conceptualized, thus it had not been factored into the equation at first. Likewise, some of the institutions could only be "open" in some areas but were nonetheless considered open.</li>
        <li>Teaching and learning pedagogies have been revised and improved as a result of digitalization, the explosion of information, and accessibility to resources on the internet.</li>
        <li>The massive digitization paved the way for the term "open and distance e-learning," or ODeL. Several forms also emerged, such as distance education and learning, flexible learning, online learning, and blended learning.</li>
        <li>The three dimensions of ODeL were finalized: open learning, distance education, and e-learning, which denote all forms of educational provisions that use contemporary technologies to enact valid combinations of synchronous and asynchronous communication between learner and educator, who may be separated from one another for part of or all of the entire learning experience.</li>
        <li>The UP Open University became part of discussions about the value of openness in teaching and learning in a digitized world, particularly at the first International Conference on Open and Distance e-Learning (ICODeL). </li>
        <li>Open and distance learning (ODL), which has been shown to be effective and is a generally recognized idea, was enhanced by the addition of the notion of e-learning.</li>
        <li>At present, the quality assurance systems of ODL are still being finalized; pointing out that the three aspects of ODeL should not be based on the standards by which residential universities are evaluated. More so, with the existing systems of evaluation and rating, open universities are pushed to be rated regardless of whether they are residential or not.</li>
        <li>Information and communication technologies (ICT) became pivotal in distance education and open learning, paving the way for the following areas where the concept of openness in ODeL occurs and helps expand the space of openness participation in the open educational resources (OER) movement and participation in the creative commons (CC), openness in the use of open source (OS), content management systems (CMS), learning management systems (LMS), the open learning network (OLN), the personal learning environment (PLE), open textbooks, and many more.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The idea of integrating e-learning compliments how open and distance learning work (Arzadon, 2017).</li>
        <li>The concept of Openness offers more opportunity for improvement; exits have been added to existing formats in certain courses and the use of tablets are now being looked into by UPOU’s own Faculty of Education (Arzadon, 2017).</li>
        <li>Being in an open learning environment makes us focus on teaching models relating to our community and its culture (Arzadon, 2017).</li>
        <li>Broadens access to quality education no matter where a student lives (Arzadon, 2017).</li>
        <li>It offers students flexibility to progress on their studies at their own pace (Arzadon, 2017).</li>
        <li>Despite students being distant from one another, this mode of learning still fosters interactivity and connectivity through group works and group discussions (Arzadon, 2017).</li>
        <li>It’s more affordable compared to a campus/classroom based learning (Benefits of Distance Learning Education - Digital Skills Global, n.d.).</li>
        <li>Institutions can update their content more at ease in this mode of learning. This is useful especially in courses relating to the digital sector (Benefits of Distance Learning Education - Digital Skills Global, n.d.).</li>

      <p><span class="higlight-text">1964:</span> Through an Administrative Order issued on April 18, 1964, Former UPLB Chancellor Emil Q. Javier formally established a task team to investigate the use of distant education to upgrade science and mathematics professors.
      </p>
      <p><span class="higlight-text">1998:</span> The UP Board of Regents launched the first formal distance education program to the Diploma in Science Teaching (DST) program, with majors in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
      </p>
      <p><span class="higlight-text">1992-1993:</span> The UP Board of Regents officially approved the UP-Distance Education Program. The next year, Dr. Emil Q. Javier was elected as the 16th President of the UP.
      </p>
      <p><span class="higlight-text">1995:</span> The foundation of UPOU as the fifth constituent of the University of the Philippines System was approved on February 23, 1995, and it became a full-fledged university.</p>
      <p><span class="higlight-text">1999:</span> UPOU was divided into four 'discipline-based Faculties'.</p>
      <p><span class="higlight-text">2018:</span> The Learning Centers were rebranded as Learning Hubs.</p>

      <p>Arzadon elaborated that open universities attract learners of various kinds, resulting in those who seek opportunities to improve knowledge and skills being referred to as lifelong learners. UPOU learners are trained on self-learning styles using strategic learning materials and resources facilitated through technology via video, gamification of modules, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). They can also communicate with teachers and co-learners via virtual classrooms, e-mail, and the online portal. Currently, UPOU provides courses via ODeL. It is part of the purpose to continue pushing forward in the field of education by making it more accessible to a larger population.
